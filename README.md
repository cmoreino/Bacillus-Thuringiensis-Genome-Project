# Bacillus-Thuringiensis-Genome-Project

This project is a hands-on replication of a full-scale genome project, focusing on the assembly and initial computational annotation of a bacterial genome. The primary goal is to learn the practical steps and bioinformatics tools used in taking raw sequencing reads and transforming them into a high-quality, annotated genome sequence.

We are working with Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterial species notable for producing proteins toxic to certain insects, which makes it valuable in the insecticide industry.
